Prescient Coding Challenge 2026 -- your submission.

THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU MAY CHANGE.

You implement one function. The harness calls it once per trading day and hands
you a `hist` object holding every observation STRICTLY BEFORE that day. You
return the weights you want to hold for that day.

    generate_weights(hist, prev_weights, params) -> weights

What you get
------------
hist.date                 the day you are allocating for (no data for it yet)
hist.returns              DataFrame [date x asset] of daily returns, decimals
hist.prices               DataFrame [date x asset] of total-return index levels
hist.macro                DataFrame [date x macro feature]
hist.assets               list of the six asset codes, in order
hist.benchmark            Series of benchmark weights
hist.active_weight(w)     total active weight of w -- the number rule 3 tests

prev_weights              what you held yesterday. Trading away from it costs
                          money, so look at it.
params                    the PARAMS dict below, passed straight through

Optional extras, in case you want them: hist.cov() gives an EWMA covariance
matrix and hist.te(w) an ex-ante tracking error. No rule depends on either.

What you must return
--------------------
Six weights (dict, Series or array in hist.assets order) that sum to 1, are all
non-negative, sit within 10% of their benchmark weight, have a total active
weight of no more than 40%, keep total equity at or below 75% and gold at or
below 10%. `make_legal()` below
already does all of that -- you can leave it alone.

Declare every tuneable number in PARAMS. Parameter count is part of the score.

Run `python harness.py` to test on the practice window (calendar 2025), then
`python validate.py` before you submit.

# This is your playground. Delete or rewrite anything here. What follows is a
# deliberately naive starting point so you can see the shape of a working
# answer. It is NOT a good answer -- on the practice window it loses to the
# benchmark. Your job is to do better.
#
# Three steps:
#   1. build a signal (here: a plain inverse-volatility tilt, which knows
#      nothing at all about expected return),
#   2. make the weights legal,
#   3. move only part of the way from yesterday, so you do not pay the full
#      trading cost every day.
#
# Steps 2 and 3 are plumbing. Keep them. Step 1 is the actual question, and
# inverse volatility is a poor answer to it: it will always prefer cash and
# bonds, whatever is happening in the world.
#
# Things worth thinking about. Which of these six assets actually diversifies
# the other five? Gold and global equity are both priced in rands -- what does
# that mean when the currency moves? The macro file has a term spread and a
# policy rate in it; what should a steepening curve do to your bond weight? And
# look at the cost table in the README before you trade property daily.
